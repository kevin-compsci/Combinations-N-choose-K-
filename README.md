# Combinations-N-choose-K-

A basic set of programs that implements a combination of N choose K (choose subsets K from set N). Please note that combinations are different from permutations. However, this version does not consider replacement so every item is seen only once per instance result. The output will be unique combinations from a given data set. This program was completed by Kevin in 2017.
